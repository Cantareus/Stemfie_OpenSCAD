# Stemfie_OpenSCAD
OpenSCAD Stemfie Library
OpenSCAD library to create parts for the [Stemfie project](https://stemfie.org)

Work in Progress! This version will probably not be forward compatible since it still needs a lot of work.

See [documentation](/Cantareus/Stemfie_OpenSCAD/blob/main/docs/stemfie.scad.md) for how to use in OpenScad
